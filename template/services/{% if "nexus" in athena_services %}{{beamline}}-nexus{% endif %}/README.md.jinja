# Nexus Setup

Before deploying Nexus, please review and update the following in your `values.yaml` file:

1. Define the storage location for Nexus files.
2. Add configuration entries for each device. Sample devices are already provided.
3. Confirm that RabbitMQ is reachable at `{{ beamline }}-rabbitmq-daq.diamond.ac.uk`.
4. Set the User ID in the security context for writing Nexus files. This is usually `{{ beamline }}-detector`.
